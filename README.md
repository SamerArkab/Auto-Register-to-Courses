#### General Info
Since access to registering to the academic courses opens for all students of the same year at the same time, I decided to write a python script using Selenium to do it for me in the quickest way possible and make sure I successfully sign up for the courses I'm interested in.

#### Technologies
* Python 3.8
* Selenium 4.4.3
* PyCharm IDE

#### Setup
Install Selenium package using,
```
pip install selenium
```
