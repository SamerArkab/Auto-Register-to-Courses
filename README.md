# Auto Register to Courses
## Using Selenium to quickly register to courses

#### General Info
Since access to registering to the academic courses opens for all students of the same year at the same time, I decided to write a python script using Selenium to do it for me in the quickest way possible and make sure I successfully sign up for the courses I'm interested in.

* Python 3.8
* Selenium 4.4.3
